	<h1>Student Health One Stop: Does your head hurt?</h1>

<!-- this is a prewritten intro to the app. -->
<div id="content" class="w3-container">
	<p> <p> Having a headache is often unsettling. One ocassional might be no deal, but what if you have them ever couple of days? what about every week?<br>
    <br>
    Sometimes we can't even sleep, study, or even be with our friends. The point is that we're responsible for monitoring ourselves during these years and times of high stress and quarantine, 
    but there are often so many different symptoms that going online to so many differently specialized websites only adds more to our headaches. <br>
    <br>
    This will be our little student-health one-stop, with everything regarding headaches and above. It's at UT, so it's easy to remember. <br>
